# My-First-Repository
Hello All....This is my first repository .
I am Ruchika Singh , a Competitive Programmer at Codechef and an Undergraduate Student of IT. I am an eager learner who loves to try my hands on different technologies with curiousity and aims at learning something new every time. Strong believer of the fact :" One never loose , either he wins or learns from it !"
